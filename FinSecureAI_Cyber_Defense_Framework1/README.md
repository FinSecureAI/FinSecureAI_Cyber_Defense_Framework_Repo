# FinSecureAI Cyber Defense Framework

FinSecureAI Cyber Defense Framework is an AI-driven cybersecurity toolkit designed to support U.S. financial institutions
in detecting and responding to fraud and cyber threats in online and digital banking channels.

The framework is aligned with U.S. regulatory expectations and guidance, including:
- NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF)
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF 2.0)
- FFIEC Information Security Booklet
- U.S. Department of the Treasury analyses of AI-related cyber risks in the financial sector

FinSecureAI is designed as a reference implementation to demonstrate how financial institutions, fintechs, and
cybersecurity partners can integrate machine learning and artificial intelligence models into existing transaction
monitoring and security operations in a way that is auditable, explainable, and compatible with regulatory oversight.
