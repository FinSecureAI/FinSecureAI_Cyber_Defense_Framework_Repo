FinSecureAI Cyber Defense Framework
The FinSecureAI Cyber Defense Framework is a technical, open-structure initiative focused on strengthening cybersecurity, fraud prevention, and operational resilience across financial institutions. The project is designed to help banks, fintech companies, credit unions, and payments platforms evaluate and improve their defenses using AI-supported anomaly detection, standardized architecture patterns, and federal regulatory alignment.
This repository contains the foundational structure, documentation folders, and initial models that support the development of a repeatable, transparent, and compliance-aligned cybersecurity framework. Content is being expanded in phases. The current version establishes the architecture, compliance mapping, pilot structure, and documentation layout needed for continued development.

Purpose of the Framework
Financial institutions continue to experience rising fraud attempts, account-takeovers, credential abuse, and emerging threats against digital banking platforms. The goal of this framework is to provide a structured, auditable foundation to:
Analyze security gaps in digital onboarding and transactional pipelines Support core detection and prevention techniques using machine learning Document standardized controls aligned with U.S. federal cybersecurity guidance  Enable future pilot projects with banks and fintech organizations 
Offer a public, transparent reference to monitor ongoing development The framework is being developed in iterative stages and reflects a technical, practical, and evidence-driven approach to improving financial sector security.

Each directory includes placeholder documents with proper headings to establish scope. More detailed content is appended as development continues.

Technical Scope
The framework is organized around several core components:
1. Architecture
High-level and detailed architecture documents covering:
Data ingestion pipelines
Secure API integrations
Identity verification workflows
AI-driven alerting and scoring modules

Defensive design patterns common to banking systems
2. Compliance & Regulatory Mapping

Structured references and mappings to:
NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF 2.0)
NIST SP 800-series controls relevant to financial services
FFIEC IT Examination Handbook (Information Security, Audit, Management)
CISA best practices and threat advisories
Industry control expectations for fraud prevention
This provides clear traceability between technical components and federal standards.

3. Pilot Deployments
Documentation templates for financial-sector pilot programs, including:
Proof-of-concept workflows
Evaluation criteria
Governance, privacy, and risk review considerations
Operational reporting samples
These documents are designed to support collaborative testing with banks or fintech partners.

4. Letters of Interest
General templates that organizations may adapt for potential participation or evaluation of the framework.

Development Status
Version: v0.1
Status: Initial structure completed.

Next Steps:
Add expanded architecture diagrams
Populate NIST/FFIEC control tables
Add sample data flows and logging patterns
Add initial AI/ML model examples
Integrate pilot project documentation

The repository will continue to evolve through incremental updates as additional components are developed.

Intended Use
This framework is intended for research, analysis, prototyping, and cooperative development. It is not a commercial product. The purpose is to document defensible methods for improving cybersecurity posture in the financial sector and to support broader public-interest cybersecurity work.
